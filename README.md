# Developing-a-Black-Friday-Python-Scraper-for-a-Non-Profit-Charity-Organization
## Background
A non-profit organization, is dedicated to providing toys to underprivileged children during the holiday season. Each year, the charity aims to deliver high-quality toys while operating within a limited budget. For the upcoming holiday season, they received increased demand but faced rising costs, making it challenging to secure enough toys.
## Problem
The organization's traditional approach involved manually tracking Black Friday deals on toys across multiple online retailers. This process was time-consuming, error-prone, and often missed the best deals due to limited manpower and timing. They needed a faster, more accurate way to find toys that matched specific price points and quality standards.
## Business Analysis Decision
### Identifying the Goal
The charity's primary objective was to ensure that every child in their program received a toy for the holidays. Their specific requirements included:
- Finding toys within a price range of <=$35.
- Prioritizing deals from reputable online retailers with reliable delivery times.
- Focusing on toys suitable for various age groups 5-12 .
- The solution needed to automate deal discovery, filter results by price and toy category, and enable bulk purchasing before deals sold out.
